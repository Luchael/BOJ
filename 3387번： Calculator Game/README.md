<p>Using a pocket calculator, enter a positive integer K and press "+". The calculator still shows the number K. Then again enter the number K. After pressing the "+" key for the second time, the result is: K + K. The game goal is to obtain a number, consisting of equal digits only, by repeating this operation many (possibly 0) times. Write a program calcgame that determines whether it is possible to reach the goal.</p>

<p>If possible, what is the first number, which consists of equal digits only and is obtained by multiple summing?</p>



## 입력


<p>On the standard input, a positive integer K is given. (1 ≤ K ≤ 999)</p>



## 출력


<p>If reaching the goal is impossible, print "Impossible". If possible, a line of the standard output should contain two integers separated by a space: the first is the digit itself and the second&nbsp;is the amount of digits of the obtained number.</p>
